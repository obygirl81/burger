Eat-Da-Burger
Application Information
This is a burger logger application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in this app, and Handlebars were used to generate your HTML.
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

How to Use App
Click the "Devour" button next to a delicious burger in the menu and watch the burger move to the already eaten burger tables. ("Yum!") or submit an order of a burger by entering the name of the burger in the “Add a Burger” field and click submit order button. This will add a new burger to the delicious burger menu on the left. When you click the “Devour it” button that appears next to the new burger, it will move into the selected burger into the already eaten table on the right. Please see a screenshot of application attached.
